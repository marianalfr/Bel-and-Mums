# Bel and Mums.

A long time ago (pre-Adalab) a friend of mine asked for a little help to boost her new business, and this website draft is part of the work I did for her. I designed her logo and visuals and created these collages for her among other things like leaflets, posters, online adds...
She loved this resposive draft with a home-page slider, but in the end she thought she needed a CMS, and since my programming knoweledge was limited to HTML, css and adding third party's js scripts, I decided to stop working on this lovely but otherwise useless project due to an absolute lack of time.
