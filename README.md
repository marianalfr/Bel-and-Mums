# Bel and Mums.

A long time ago (pre-Adalab) a friend of mine asked for a little help to boost her new business, and this website draft is part of the work I did for her. I designed her logo and visuals and created these collages for her among other things like leaflets, posters, online adds...
She loved this resposive draft, but in the end she wanted a CMS and my programming knoweledge was limited to HTML, css and adding third party's js scripts, so I stopped working on this project due to an absolute lack of time.
